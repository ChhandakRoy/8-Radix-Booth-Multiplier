# 8-Radix and 4-Radix Booth-Multiplier
The 8-radix booth multiplier has been implemented using the 8 radix booth algorithm, which enables it to perform both signed and unsigned 8-bit multiplication .
And the 4-Radix Booth multiplier uses radix 4 booth algoithm and can do 8 bit multiplication.

Both the multiplier have been designed using 4 units as follows:
1.Decoder
2. Control unit
3. Partial Product generator
4.Partial product adder
