# 8-Radix-Booth-Multiplier
The 8-radix booth multiplier has been implemented using the 8 radix booth algorithm, which enables it to perform both signed and unsigned 8-bit multiplication .

It has been designed using 4 units as follows:
1.Decoder
2. Control unit
3. Partial Product generator
4.Partial product adder
